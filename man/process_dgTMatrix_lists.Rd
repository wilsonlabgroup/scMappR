\arguments{
\item{dgTMatrix_list}{A list of matrices in the class of dgTMatrix object -- sparce object -- compatible with Seurat rownames should be of the same species for each.}

\item{name}{The name of the outputted signature matrices, cell-type preferences, and seurat objects if you choose to save them.}

\item{species_name}{Mouse or human symbols, -9 if internal as panglao objects have gene symbol and ensembl strapped together.}

\item{naming_preference}{For cell-type naming, see if cell-types given the inputted tissues are more likely to be named within one of the categories of get_naming_preference_options().}

\item{rda_path}{If saved, directory to where data from scMappR_data is downloaded.}

\item{panglao_set}{If the inputted matrices are from Panglao (i.e. if they're internal).}

\item{haveUMAP}{Save the UMAPs -- only use if the package is downloaded with pip.}

\item{saveSCObject}{Save the Seurat object as an RData object (T/F).}

\item{internal}{Was this used as part of the internal processing of Panglao datasets (T/F).}

\item{toSave}{Allow scMappR to write files in the current directory (T/F)}

\item{path}{If toSave == TRUE, path to the directory where files will be saved.}

\item{use_sctransform}{If you should use sctransform or the Normalize/VariableFeatures/ScaleData pipeline (T/F).}

\item{test_ctname}{statistical test for calling CT markers -- must be in Seurat}
}
\value{
List with the following elements:
\item{wilcoxon_rank_mat_t}{A dataframe containing the signature matrix of ranks (-log10(Padj) * sign(fold-change)).}
\item{wilcoxon_rank_mat_or}{A dataframe containing the signature matrix of odds-ratios.}
\item{generes}{All cell-type markers for each cell-type with p-value and fold changes.}
}
\description{
This function takes a list of count matrices, processes them, calls cell-types, and generates signature matrices.
}
\details{
This function is a one line wrapper to process count matrices into a signature matrix.
It combines process_from_count, two methods of identifying cell-type identities (GSVA and Fisher's test).
Then, it takes the output of cell-type markers and converts it into a signature matrix of p-value ranks and odds ratios.
Along the way, it saves the Seurat object (if chosen with saveSCObject), cell-type identites from GSVA (its own obect), and the signature matrices.
Cell-type marker outputs are also saved in the generes.RData list. Names of the generes objects and the signature matrices are kept.
