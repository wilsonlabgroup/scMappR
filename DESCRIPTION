Description: Statistical tools to interrogate the cell-type specificity of any gene list given a matrix of cell-types and genes associated with those cell-types (a signature matrix). Additionally, a library of over 300 signature matrices from public data are stored. Together, there are four primary functions: (i) processing scRNA-seq count data and automated cell-type naming using Seurat V3 and enrichment of CellMarker and Panglao databases, (ii) tissue-by-cell-type gene set enrichment, (iii) cell-type specific enrichment of a gene list within a particular tissue, (iv) weighted cell-type specific reranking of a list of differentially expressed genes.
