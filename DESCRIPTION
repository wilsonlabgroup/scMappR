Description: We built an R package called scMappR, which contains statistical tools to interrogate the cell-type specificity of any gene list given a matrix of cell-types and genes associated with those cell-types (a signature matrix). We further processed re-aligned scRNA-seq data from panglaoDB (cite) and provided signature matrices across hundreds of tissues from mouse and human samples (described below). This R package has a number of uses including the (i) processing scRNA-seq count data and automated cell-type naming using Seurat V3 and enrichment of CellMarker and Panglao databases, (ii) tissue-by-cell-type gene set enrichment, (iii) cell-type specific enrichment of a gene list within a particular tissue, (iv) weighted cell-type specific reranking of a list of differentially expressed genes.
