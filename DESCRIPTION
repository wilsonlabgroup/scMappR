Description: *Description of scMappR R package adapted from pre-print*. The single cell mapper (scMappR) R package contains a suite of bioinformatic tools that provide experimentally relevant cell-type specific information to a list of differentially expressed genes (DEG). The function "scMappR_and_pathway_analysis" reranks DEGs to generate cell-type specificity scores called cell-weighted fold-changes. Users input a list of DEGs, normalized counts, and a signature matrix into this function. scMappR then re-weights bulk DEGs by cell-type specific expression from the signature matrix, cell-type proportions from RNA-seq deconvolution and the ratio of cell-type proportions between the two conditions to account for changes in cell-type proportion. With cwFold-changes calculated, scMappR uses two approaches to utilize cwFold-changes to complete cell-type specific pathway analysis. The "process_dgTMatrix_lists" function in the scMappR package contains an automated scRNA-seq processing pipeline where users input scRNA-seq count data, which is made compatible for scMappR and other R packages that analyze scRNA-seq data. We further used this to store hundreds up regularly updating signature matrices. The functions "tissue_by_celltype_enrichment", "tissue_scMappR_internal", and "tissue_scMappR_custom" combine these consistently processed scRNAseq count data with gene-set enrichment tools to allow for cell-type marker enrichment of a generic gene list (e.g. GWAS hits).
